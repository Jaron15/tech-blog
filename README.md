# tech-blog
This project is an interactive full stack application named The Tech Blog. The tech blog allows people to create profiles from which they can post, comment and view other blog posts. The application uses 
MYSQL2 and Sequelize to connect to the database and the dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like a userâ€™s MySQL username, password, and database name. The application is also deployed to heroku so it can be visited from the link found in the references.


# Features
* Once in the application you can create a profile by clicking login at the top of the page and filling out the signup form in the login page
